# Battery status API implementation (day 1)

Battery status API implementation, 

I made this demo to test the Battery API as a part of a **30 day, 30 browser API's personal challenge** as the **day 1**.

This demo took me a few hours and it's pretty rough. Its goal was to show one possible way to get the battery relevant information.

I don't plan to update this project in the future, but I will be giving support If needed and update It If a relevant pull request is made, so feel free to fork It and play with It.

For a full preview about this particular demo, **[Watch it here!](https://behagoras.github.io/battery-api/)** It uses the [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API) which is deprecated, but It was fun to implement.
